Module 2: Bot Detection Lab
*******************************

In this Lab we want to get familar with all the additional features avaialble for Bot Defense. The goal is to create a Bot Defenses profile with more granular.

.. important :: To only focus on Bot Defense, we will use the "Hackazon_BaDOS_protected" virtual server for this, because there is no WAF policy attached to it. If you wanna use a different VS, please make sure that there is no WAF policy active.
